Hi, I'm just a guy who you probably know either from class, school, or my project: ClassKicker.\
I’m currently learning PowerShell, and I've gotten quite good at it\
God, GLSL has way too much math involved...\
I’m a `one-man team`, and I find collaborating in code a bit difficult, but I can make it work if I really need to!\
You can contact me at my email `pastrikk00@gmail.com`!\
I barely check my email, for faster communication, here's my Discord : shrekman#0574

## Languages I know quite well:
-Python\
-C#\
-JS

## I partially know these languages:
Java\
C++ (Original Classkicker GUI was made with C++)\
GLSL (Not a programming language, its a shading language)


### I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST CLASSKICK NOR DO I ENCOURAGE HEAVY ABUSE OF THE GOOGLE CLASSROOM API.

> This is a constant cycle of agony
