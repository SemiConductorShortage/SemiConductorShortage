Hi, I'm just a guy who you probably know either from class, school, or my project: ClassKicker.\
I prefer working solo and I find collaborating in code a bit difficult, but I can make it work if I really need to!\
You can contact me at my email `pastrikk00@gmail.com`!\
I barely check my email, for faster communication, here's my Discord : shrekman#0574

## Languages I know quite well:
-Python\
-C++\
-JS\
-Powershell is defined as an object oriented language, so that counts

## I partially know these languages:
Java\
C#\
GLSL (Not a programming language, its a shading language)


### I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST CLASSKICK NOR DO I ENCOURAGE HEAVY ABUSE OF THE GOOGLE CLASSROOM API. 


> yes guys i know powershell 😎
