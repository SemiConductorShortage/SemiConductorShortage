Hi, I'm just a guy who you probably know either from class, school, or my project: ClassKicker.\
I’m interested in Data Science and Analytics. To say ***"Data is interesting"*** would be a massive understatement.\
I’m currently learning C# for some GUI applications (I've been doing this for like 2 months now), and GLSL for personal hobby usage.\
God, GLSL has way too much math involved...\
I’m a `one-man team`, and I find collaborating in code a bit difficult, but I can make it work if I really need to!\
You can contact me at my email `pastrikk00@gmail.com`!\
I barely check my email, for faster communication, here's my Discord : shrekman#0574

## Languages I know quite well:
-Python\
-C#\
-JS

## I partially know these languages:
Java\
C++ (Original Classkicker GUI was made with C++)\
GLSL (Not a programming language, its a shading language)


### I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST CLASSKICK NOR DO I ENCOURAGE HEAVY ABUSE OF THE GOOGLE CLASSROOM API. IT IS SIMPLY A PROJECT TO BE SHARED ACROSS THE SCHOOL OF WINCHESTER JEBEL ALI.
